            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Behold unto you it is given forth and declared, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and reſtauration of the ſeed, the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> came, and now is coming the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation, even he cometh now in ſpirit and in power, who was the Rock whom your Fathers in the Wilderneſs forſook; and the light of the world whom your Fathers ſlew at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> which brought a a grievous curſe upon you of being a people troden upon by all the world, and not onely ſo, but the moſt lamentable thing and curſe which is over you; for which cauſe my ſoul mourns for you, that ſuch cruel hard heartedneſs, diſtruſt, doubt, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and unbelief, coveting, fraud, deceit, diſſimulation, and Hypocriſie hath vailed your hearts, and groſsly darkned your underſtandings.</p>
            <p>Oh that is the worſt of all! that is the greateſt curſe, in how much throughout ages, the <hi>Iews</hi> have been given over unto vile affections, hard heartedneſs; ſinne and unbelief; which is the cauſe why ye cannot rightly ſpeak of the things of God, and underſtand the Prophets writings which were ſpoken,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17 2.</note> and do ſtand as myſteries, yea deep myſteries to your thick hearts, your underſtandings being covered as with a thick cloud of darkneſs, (which now we the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the true <hi>Iew</hi> inwardly,<note place="margin">

            <p>The Prophets they propheſied of the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> to come in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in a myſtery to the whole world <hi>Iew</hi> and Gentile, ſo that when he came he was not received but by the Remnant in them dayes, as he is received now in theſe dayes; but unto whom the ſpirit of wiſdome and underſtanding was given, to read and underſtand that which the Prophets ſpake forth in Parables,

to the whole world of mankind,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20 49.</note> which lay in ſin and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
            <p>And therefore ye <hi>Iews</hi> now in theſe dayes, ye ought not to ſpeak of God, or to name his name in perverſeneſſe, whileſt ye hate to be reformed in your hearts, minds and ſpirits, but ye ought to hear the meſſage of the Lord God, and to ponder it in your hearts, that you may ſee how farre ye are yet from the Promiſe, being not come in truth, in ſpirit and in life, unto the condition thereof fulfilled and made up in you, untill which ye cannot juſtly expect the fulfilling of the promiſe unto you in the ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>For whileſt you are in your ſins, as your Fathers were in their ſins in the day that they ſlew Ieſus at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> you cannot but as men in the fleſh, look with any other than an eye of fleſh, for a God of fleſh to come among you, and to ſave you by the Arme of fleſh. Oh blind and ſottiſh, of dull ears and dark underſtandings! and ſo could not your Fathers, neither can you now as you ſtand, ſee him that cometh to ranſome the ſeed in ſpirit and in power.</p>
            <p>Behold none other but <hi>Immanuel</hi> the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> which is God with us, the light of the world that is come unto us, and is paſſing through the whole world, who will ſmite the earth with the Rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he ſhall ſlay the wicked.</p>

            <p>Againe I ſay waite upon God, with your minds ſtaid upon the light in all your conſciences, and thereby God will ſhew you, even by the coming of his Son Ieſus the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> the light of the World, the fulfilling of the Law and of the Prophets in you, (that is to ſay, thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy minde, and with all thy ſoul, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,) this is the ſum and ſubſtance of all, which the light in all your conſciences if ye follow it in your minds, will perfectly lead to the fulfilling of; and then ye will know that <hi>Immanuel</hi> the light of the VVorld, came not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Law but to fulfill the Law; that the righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit; which is according to the leadings of the light in all our conſciences; and this is from the Lord both to the Iew and to the Gentile.</p>
            <p>Furthermore to the ſcattered Tribes of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> This is the word of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth; who is the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who by a mighty hand and cut-ſtretched arme, by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Prophet and Meſſenger unto the ſeed in Bondage in great Captivity, brought the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Even unto you Oh ye <hi>Iews</hi> this is the word of the dreadfull Lord God of Hoſts; and as a ſign unto you, and among you, and in you, it ſhall ſtand unto the end of your dayes, if you periſh in unbeliefe and in your ſins; that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come, Ieſus whom your Fathers ſlew through unbelief and hard-heartedneſſe in their dayes, who ſlew him for ſaying in words, that which they themſelves, did own concerning themſelves in the ſubſtance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their profeſſion; that is to ſay, he declared that he was the Son of God, and therefore they put him to death
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42936:5"/>
as a Blaſphemer, and they ſaid that God was their Father, yet were in their wilfullneſſe ſo far blinded that they could not diſcerne, that their words in manner of the declaration, tended to the ſame thing, and was of the ſame nature, and this ſhall ſtand the ſign thereof unto the end, if ye periſh in unbelief to your perpetuall judgement, that he hath lightned you all, with his true light which ſhineth in all your conſciences which ſheweth you in ſecret, the deceitfulneſſe of your hearts, and convinceth you in your minds, of lying, cheating, coveting, envy and of all ſin and unrighteouſneſſe, (which is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of God, written in your hearts, this ſign) the light in your conſciences ſhall never dye in you, which all your burning Lamps, and waſhings, and Altars, and vails, and holyeſt of holyeſt, and all the other ceremonies, were but ſigns and figures and ſhadows of this everlaſting ſigne and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which ſhall perpetually ſtand to juſtifie you if you love it, and follow it, and walk according to it, or to condemne you for evermore if ye have it, and walk contrary to it.</p>
            <p>And be it alſo known unto you, that if you expect another <hi>Meſsiah</hi> then him that is come (which is <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with us in ſpirit and in life and in power), leading out of ſin, the land of bondage and darkneſſe and in vertue, and in wiſdome, and in counſel, and in judgement, not judging according to the ſeeing of the eye, or hearing of the eare, but with righteous judgement in ſpirit, who ſearches every ſpirit, and the bottome of every heart, with his light in every conſcience ye are but <hi>Seekers</hi> unto this day for fleſh to come; yet farther to be an eaſe unto your fleſh, and to purchaſe more eaſe and liberty for your fleſh, in which ſtate ye already ſtand, even in the eaſe and luſt of the fleſh, which God Almighty by the coming of his Son, will deſtroy, for becauſe of ſin and iniquitie, and men living in the eaſe and luſt of the fleſh, the Lord God will haſten iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the earth.</p>
            <p>Now conſider, ſearch and ſee, ponder it and lay it to heart, that you may know what you have waited for; that you may underſtand whether you have waited and ſought for the true thing to come to paſs, that henceforth ye may ſeek aright elſe you may all waite till your limbs fails you, and your eyes periſh
